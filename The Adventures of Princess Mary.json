			The Great Woods, standing tall for thousands of years, held many secrets inside. Princess Mary stood at the base of the endless forest. Two paths were clear in front of her. 
			The first on her left showed fallen leaves delicately glimmering in the early morning light. The songs of birds whistled in the air. The second on her right displayed land draped in shadows. 
			The silhouette of a fallen could be seen farther in the path. Something rustled in the bushes.",

			Mary walked in peace for hours until she suddenly stumbled on a tour. The looming, circular stack of stone casted a long shadow over the land. 
			On arrival, Mary realized the singing was not that of birds, rather of a girl. A stunningly beautiful pale girl sat perched in the window of the tower, singing somberly. 
			Her golden hair fell far past what could be seen through the window.",

			\“Rapunzal,\” she peaked her eyes back out. Mary walked to the base of the tower.
			\“Is there any way up?\” Mary asked. Faster than she perceived, a glowing golden mass fell downward. Mary flopped against the ground, her rib cage aching.
			\“Oh shoot! I am so sorry!\” Rapunzal cried, \“My hair is the only way I know up, so I just - I am sorry!\”
			Mary smiled widely. \“It’s alright. Nothing a little ice can’t fix.\” Mary pushed off the tail end of Rapunzal’s hair and proceeded to climb.

			\“Who are you and what do you want?\” she interrogated. The frog shook his head.
			\“No, no, don’t be frightened! I am Prince Ferdinand. I was cursed to be a frog and require a kiss to turn human again,\” he explained. 
			\“Everything okay down there?\” Rapunzal called.
			Mary glanced up, smirking. \“I think I have an idea.\”
			With Rapunzal’s kiss, the frog returned to his royal form. The three celebrated late into the night. Mary returned home with a skip in her step under the glittering moonlight. 
			She crawled into bed, eyes fluttering to a close, eagerly awaiting morning.",
