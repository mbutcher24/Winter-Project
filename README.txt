# The Adventures Of Princess Mary

Choose your own adventure guiding Princess Mary.

## Description

*\"The Adventures Of Princess Mary\" is a choose-your-own adventure where players can cycle through different paths on their way to a fun adventure. You can choose how you would like to proceed along three seperate routes. Choices overlap, take you backward, or merge paths. The program integrates images, text, and buttons for the purpose of aiding in the story. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* You will need libraries including json, tkinter, PIL, and functools. You will need a computer that can run those libraries, such as Windows or Mac.

### Installing

* I have included my GitHub repository link. Navigate that to find, open, and run \"Princess Mary.py.\" After that, a window with the game titled \"Princess Mary.py\" should be opened on your computer. 

### Executing program

* Open \"Princess Mary.py\" with Notepad or copy and paste code into a Repl.it.
* If on Repl.it, press \"Run\" button at the top of your screen. If using Notepad, click \"Run\" at the top right on the window.
* Press buttons on the screen with choices for how to move the story forward contained inside.
